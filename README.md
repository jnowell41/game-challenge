# wasp-game-challenge

Create a simple text only game with a single button that hits a random wazp from a
nest of wazps. Each time the button is pressed, a wasp is hit and its points reduced.
Once its points have gone to zero the wazp dies and cannot be hit again. The screen
shows the state of all the wazps after each hit.
The game is over when all wasps have died. You should be able to start a new game
once the game is over.
You should be able to solve this in under 150 lines including comments and any
more than that is a sign you have overcomplicated the problem. You can use basic
html and css to tidy up the output, but the solution should be simple text and a button
rather than any styled UI.
You start the game with the following wazps.
1 x Queen
­ 80 Hit Points
­ Loses 7 hit points every time it is hit
­ All wazps die if the queen is killed
5 x Worker wazps
­ Each one starts with 68 hit points
­ Each one Loses 10 hit points each time it is hit
8 x Drone wazps
­ Each starts with 60 hit points
­ Each loses 12 hit points each time it is hit.
This task should take no more than 60­90 minutes to complete.
